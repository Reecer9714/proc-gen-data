# Design Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the design principles and structure for the data used in an RPG game. The data is designed to be implementation-agnostic, allowing it to be used across various programming languages and platforms. The focus is on modularity, reusability, and clarity.

## General Guidelines

1. **Modularity**: Data should be broken into small, reusable components.
2. **Consistency**: Naming conventions, schema structures, and data types should be consistent.
3. **Extensibility**: The system should allow for easy addition of new features, entities, or mechanics.
4. **Validation**: Use JSON schemas to validate data integrity.
5. **Documentation**: Each component should be well-documented to ensure clarity.

## JSON Schema Usage

- Use JSON schemas to define and validate the structure of each data type.
- Schemas should be modular and reference each other where applicable.

## Future Considerations

- Support for dynamic effects and conditions.
- Localization for display strings.
- Advanced targeting mechanics (e.g., line of sight, obstacles).
